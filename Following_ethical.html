        <h2>What is my responsibility and that of others? What support is there?</h2>
        <p>A situation may arise where you suspect a fellow researcher is thinking about behaving irresponsibly or has already done so. It is also possible that you have evidence of wrongdoing. The individual may be at your same hierarchical level or higher up, in your same research group or in a different one. These situations are uncomfortable, but looking the other way is inappropriate. Not taking action may compromise the integrity of the research enterprise with potential consequences to other individuals and society. What are some steps that you can take? Is whistleblowing the appropriate course of action?</p>

        <p class="mt-8 mb-4">In the United States, the responsibility to establish policies and provide support on research integrity is distributed among various agencies, such as the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (for public health services–related cases) and the Office of the Inspector General (for other federal violations). In the United Kingdom, the UK Research Integrity Office (UKRIO) provides independent, expert, and confidential support on research integrity across all disciplines of research, from the arts and humanities to the life sciences.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Now that you have learned the role and obligations of individuals, institutions, and organizations and understand the steps you can take to report suspected violations of responsible behavior in research, reflect on the best course of action for anyone facing such a situation.</p>
